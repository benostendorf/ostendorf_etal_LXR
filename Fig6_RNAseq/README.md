# RNA-seq of OT-I cells in co-culture with LXR-/- BMDCs

In this experiment the impact of RGX-104 on the transcriptional profile of OT-I T cells in  co-culture with BMDCs isolated from LXR double-knockout (LXR-DKO) mice was assessed. Libraries were prepared with the Illumina Truseq kit. 


To reproduce the data, follow the following steps:
- Clone the repository to your local device
- Navigate to `R/Fig6_RNAseq.Rmd` and execute the R markdown script. 

Please note that to re-create the expression heatmap from Figure 6e run the code contained in `Fig6_ATACseq`.
